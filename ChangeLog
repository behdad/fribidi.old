2000-11-12  Dov Grobgeld  <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>

	* fribidi.c: [OZ] Applied Owen Taylor's patch from 2000-07-19 to
	fribidi.c.  The patch affects pp->prev rules for the last element
	in cases W3 and W7.
	
	* fribidi.c: [OZ] fribidi_log2vis() and
	fribidi_log2vis_get_embedding_levels() now check for len==0 and if
	so, they return immediately (instead of getting stuck).

	* fribidi.c: [OZ] new_type_link() is now declared as
	new_type_link(void) to prevent a compiler error message.

	* fribidi.c: [OZ] The positions of the is_v2l_map and len
	arguments in fribidi_map_range() prototype were switched around,
	to conform to actual use in the source code file. 
	
	* fribidi.c: [OZ] The first argument to fribidi_is_char_rtl() was
	changed from gint8 to guint8, to conform to data type returned by
	fribidi_log2vis().  
	
	* fribidi.c: [OZ] bidi_string_strlen() now uses gint rather than int.

	* fribidi.c: [OZ] bidi_string_reverse() now uses gint rather than int.
	
	* fribidi.c: [OZ] int16_array_reverse() is now guint16_array_reverse().

	* fribidi.c: Added define symbols NO_STDIO, FRIBIDI_MAX_STRING_LENGTH,
	USE_SIMPLE_MALLOC that may be used to effect what code is being 
	generated.

	* fribidi_char_sets.h, fribidi_char_sets.c : Added Omer Zaks more 
	general ut8 to unicode and unicode to ut8 functions.
	
	* fribidi.c: [OZ] Replaced int to gint to better support embedded
	libraries.

	* Applied lots of code contributed by Omer Zak <omerz@actcom.co.il> ,
	detailed above.
	

2000-10-14  Dov Grobgeld  <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>

	* Released fribidi-0.1.14.

	* CreateGetType.pl, fribidi_tables.i: Applied a patch received
 	from Roozbeh Pournader <roozbeh@sina.sharif.ac.ir> (who has got
 	quite some courage sending an email from Iran to Israel) which
	updates the character tables according to UnicodeData-3.0.1.txt .

	* fribidi_char_sets.c: Cleaned up the mess and made it compile!

2000-10-09  Dov Grobgeld  <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>

	* Released fribidi-0.1.13 .

	* acinclude.m4: Added file including a m4 macro for glib-2.0
	as suggested by Owen Taylor.

	* Makefile.am: Added acinclude.m4 to extra sources.

	* configure.in: Changed it to use new macro.

2000-05-19  Dov Grobgeld  <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>

	* fribidi_char_sets.c: Added support for the LRM and RLM 
	characters for the iso-8859-8 converts at unused positions 
	0xFE and 0xFF . 

	* CreateGetType.PL, fribidi.c, fribidi_tables.i, fribidi_types.h:
 	Updated the algorithms to be consistance with the latest Unicode
 	Technical Report #9 release. Still no explicit overrides, but
 	hopefully the implicit algorithm now works according to the
 	specification.

	* CreateGetType.PL, fribidi_tables.i: Overwrote the character
 	bidi-assignment of all non-assigned characters within blocks with
 	the property of the previous character in order to create a few
 	more reused secondary lookup character tables.

	* CreateGetType.PL, fribidi.c, fribidi_tables.i: Added Owen
 	Taylor's speed patch that speeds up fribidi by a factor of 4!
  	Owen's patch consists of two parts. The first part is a double
 	table lookup scheme for accessing the character properties,
 	replacing the old binary search. The second part is a reuse of the
 	links in the character properties linked list in order to minimize
 	mallocs.

2000-05-02  Dov Grobgeld  <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>

2000-03-20  Dov Grobgeld  <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>

	* Released fribidi-0.1.9 .

2000-02-22  Dov Grobgeld  <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>

	* fribidi_types.h: Changed basic type FriBidiChar to guint32
	  which corresponds to UCS4, which is more reasonable to use.

2000-02-21  Dov Grobgeld  <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>

	* tests/test-capital-rtl: Added new tests to check percentage
	  signs and updated tests.reference to reflect this.

	* fribidi.c(fribidi_analyse_string): Added the rule 
	  EN,ET=>EN,EN which takes care of the problem of percentage
	  signs were put in the wrong place.

2000-02-20  Dov Grobgeld  <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>

	* fribidi.c: Fixed several memory leaks found by Owen Taylor.

1999-12-24  Dov Grobgeld  <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>

	* Added new function fribidi_is_char_rtl() that uses the 
	embedding levels or the base dir to determine the resolved
	direction of a character.

	* Added new function fribidi_xpos_resolve() to fribidi_utils 
	that is needed in an gui interaction to resolve a mouse event 
	to the proper logical and visual positions.

1999-12-05  Dov Grobgeld  <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>

	* Added two new types FRIBIDI_TYPE_WL and FRIBIDI_TYPE_WR that
	indicate weak directions. These directions are used if no strong
	direction is found in the string.

	* Changed analyse_string() to return base_type FRIBIDI_TYPE_N if
	the base direction cannot be determined. It is then up to a higher
	level protocol to determine the base direction.
