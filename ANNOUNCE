I have relased a new version 0.1.15 of fribidi which is mainly based
on a set of excellent patches that I received from Omer Zak
<omerz@actcom.co.il>. The highlights of the changes are:

     * Made several compile options for better fine tuning for embedded
       systems.

     * Fixed some bugs in complience of unicode algorithm.

     * Fixed interface in which the v2l and the l2v maps were
       mixed up.

Here's the blurb in case someone missed it:

FriBidi is a free BiDi library that should adher closely to the Unicode 
BiDi algorithm.

FriBidi is written in C and should provide a common API that will 
facilitate porting of various software to support BiDirection 
locals.

FriBidi may be found at:

Here is an example of what the library can do, where capital letters
are treated as having Right-To-Left direction.
